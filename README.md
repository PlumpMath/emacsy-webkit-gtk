Emacsy WebKit GTK Browser Example
=================================

This program contains an example program for
[Emacsy](https://github.com/shanecelis/emacsy).  It is a barebones
browser with an echo-area/minibuffer any Emacsian will love.  

Running
-------

I recommend grabbing the [latest Emacsy
release](https://github.com/shanecelis/emacsy/releases) which has this
project included as one of its demos.
